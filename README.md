*   **VRChat SDK:** The official SDK for creating VRChat content.

## Workflow

1.  **Modeling:** Create the avatar model in Blender. The placeholder file `Assets/Models/avatar.blend` should be replaced with your model.
2.  **Texturing:** Create and apply textures to the model. The placeholder file `Assets/Textures/texture.png` should be replaced with your texture.
3.  **Rigging:** Rig the model with a skeleton. The placeholder file `Assets/Rigs/rig.blend` should be replaced with your rig.
4.  **Unity Setup:** Import the model into Unity and set up the VRChat components.
5.  **Testing:** Test the avatar in VRChat.
6.  **Upload:** Upload the avatar to VRChat.
